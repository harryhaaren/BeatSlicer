# BeatSlicer
Tentative to make a beatslicer with jack support in C 

TODO:
- Implement playback modes 
- Create a basic command line user interface for testing/monitoring/debugging
- Add Stereo support 
- Implement presets [save/load]
- Make a proper midi implementation
- Create a mixer structure with basic functions to avoid clipping
